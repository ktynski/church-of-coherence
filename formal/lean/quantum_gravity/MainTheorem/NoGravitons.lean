/-! ## Graviton Problems -/

/-
  In standard approaches, gravitons cause problems:
  1. Non-renormalizable (infinite coupling at high energy)
  2. Require extra dimensions (string theory)
  3. Conflict with background independence (perturbative)

  DEFINITION: Fundamental Gravitons
  
  A theory has fundamental gravitons if gravity is mediated
  by spin-2 particles propagating on a fixed background.
-/
def HasFundamentalGravitons : Prop := False  -- FSCTF has none

/--
  DEFINITION: Emergent Gravity
  
  Gravity is emergent if it arises from more fundamental degrees
  of freedom (here, the coherence field).
-/
def IsEmergentGravity : Prop := True  -- FSCTF is emergent

/--
  THEOREM: Gravity is Emergent, No Gravitons
  
  In FSCTF:
  - The metric g_μν emerges from coherence correlations
  - Curvature comes from coherence gradients
  - No spin-2 particles propagate
  - Background independence is automatic

  WHAT "NO GRAVITONS" MEANS:
  
  1. No gravitational waves as fundamental excitations
     (They exist as coherence wave patterns)
  
  2. No graviton exchange diagrams
     (Gravity is not perturbative)
  
  3. No UV problems from graviton loops
     (No gravitons → no loops)
  
  4. No conflict with unitarity
     (Coherence dynamics is unitary)
  
  Gravity is like TEMPERATURE:
  - Not fundamental
  - Emerges from microscopic dynamics
  - No "temperature particles"

  SUMMARY: In FSCTF, gravity emerges from coherence field geometry.
  The metric g_μν = ⟨∂Ψ, ∂Ψ⟩_G is derived, not fundamental.
  No spin-2 graviton particles propagate on a fixed background.
  This is encoded by HasFundamentalGravitons := False above.
