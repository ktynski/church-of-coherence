  Golden Ratio: Basic Properties
  
  This file establishes the fundamental properties of φ = (1 + √5)/2
  that underpin both the Yang-Mills mass gap and P vs NP analyses.
  
  KEY THEOREM: φ satisfies the self-consistency equation φ² = φ + 1
  This is the same equation that appears in:
  - SCCMU Theory (coherence maximization)
  - Geometry of Mind (Grace operator)
  - Fibonacci anyons (quantum dimension)

  THE CORE THEOREM: φ² = φ + 1
  
  This self-referential equation is the source of all φ-structure.
  It says: "the square of the whole equals the whole plus unity"
  
  This same equation appears in:
  1. SCCMU: Λ² = Λ + 1 (coherence self-consistency)
  2. Fibonacci: F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n) limiting ratio
  3. Geometry of Mind: Grace operator eigenvalue
